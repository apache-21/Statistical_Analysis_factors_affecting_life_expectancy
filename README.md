# Project Title : Statistical Analysis Of Factors Affecting Life Expectancy.

## Capstone Project: Statistical Analysis on factors influencing Life Expectancy

In the last 15 years, there has been immense development in the healthcare sector resulting in an improvement of human mortality rates especially in the developing nations. In the past, a lot of studies on life expectancy have been undertaken considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates. The effect of immunization and human development index (HDI) was not taken into account in the past. This project will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors affecting life expectancy.

The project aims to answer the following key questions:

* __1. What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?__

* __2. Should a country having a lower life expectancy value (<65 years) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?__

* __3. What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?


__The dataset used:__

_The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website. In this project we will consider data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries. The dataset has 22 columns and 2938 rows, which means 20 predicting variables. All the predicting variables will be divided into several broad categories: â€‹Immunization related factors, Mortality factors, Economical factors and Social factors._
