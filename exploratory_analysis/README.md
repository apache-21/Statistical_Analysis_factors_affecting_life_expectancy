__Features Descriptions__

life_expectancy :
Life expectancy, estimate of the average number of additional years that a person of a given age can expect to live. The most common measure of life expectancy is life expectancy at birth. Life expectancy is a hypothetical measure. It assumes that the age-specific death rates for the year in question will apply throughout the lifetime of individuals born in that year.  unit -years

adult_mortality :
Probability that a 15 year old person will die before reaching his/her 60th birthday. The adult mortality rate shown in the World Development Indicators (WDI) database and related products refers to the probability that those who have reached age 15 will die before reaching age 60 (shown per 1,000 persons). In other words, a value of 150 means that out of 1,000 persons who have reached age 15, 150 are expected to die before reaching age 60, and 850 are expected to survive to age 60. This is based on a “synthetic cohort”: current life-table mortality rates are applied to the current cohort of 15 year olds, assuming no changes in mortality. unit - numbers

infant_deaths :
Infant mortality is the death of young children under the age of 1, i.e before is first birthday. This death toll is measured by the infant mortality rate (IMR), which is the probability of deaths of children under one year of age per 1000 live births.

alcohol:
alcohol consumption mortality - The percentage of alcohol-attributable deaths

percentage_expenditure :
Per capita total expenditure on health - This indicator is defined as the per capita total expenditure on health, expressed at the average exchange rate for that year in US$. It shows the total expenditure on health relative to the beneficiary population, expressed in US$ to facilitate international comparisons.

gdp:
Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period. As a broad measure of overall domestic production, it functions as a comprehensive scorecard of a given country’s economic health.
